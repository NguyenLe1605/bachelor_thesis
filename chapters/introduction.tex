\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}

  More embedded device, => increase the incentivize to protect the with better security protocol.
  As VPN is mentioned in many papers as not suitable for constrained small IoT Devices, 
  I start to question, is it really the true for in this modern area. 
  As a modern network protocols called wireguard show up, with an aim to replace
  the old, sound but complex protocols like IPSec, we here consider adapting the wireguard
  protocols onto this constrained IoT environment, to see whether this VPN protocol is 
  a good fit for the IoT world or not.

  Threat model is to privacy of the IPv6 packet can't be trace, and end-to-end security 
  of the sending IP packet where we can't trust the middle router to no have a peak
  on the sending data.

  This thesis provives an overview of a simple security protoocls called Wireguard, 
  present the design the implementation for the IoT and discuesses the security
  properties that it can bring to the IoT worlds.

  WireGuard [23] is a new VPN protocol that fits the role of this new pipe
and it looks quite promising. Note that WireGuard was originally presented
at NDSS 2017 [15], but while the main concepts still apply, the protocol has
slightly evolved in an incompatible way. The latest version is described in
the WireGuard whitepaper [18].
WireGuard is designed using modern cryptography, aims for high per-
formance and reduces the attack surface as a simple protocol. Unlike other
protocols, no form of negotiation over cryptographic parameters is possible.
\section{Organization}

  Chapter 2 discusses about the background knowlegde of IoT, RIOT Operating system, and the
  6LoWPAN network stack.

  Chapter 3 is about the underlying network stack that powers RIOT - GNRC.

  Chapter 4 is a thorough explaination of the wireguard protocol.

  Chapter 5 gives an evaluation of wireguard security, and how it help
  the IoT world.

  Chapter 6 discusses the design and implementation of wireguard.


  Chapter 7: conclusion and future works of this thesis.
