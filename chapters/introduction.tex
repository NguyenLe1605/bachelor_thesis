\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
  As VPN is mentioned in many papers as not suitable for constrained small IoT Devices, 
  I start to question, is it really the true for in this modern area. 
  As a modern network protocols called wireguard show up, with an aim to replace
  the old, sound but complex protocols like IPSec, we here consider adapting the wireguard
  protocols onto this constrained IoT environment, to see whether this VPN protocol is 
  a good fit for the IoT world or not.
\section{Organization}

  Chapter 2 discusses about the background knowlegde of IoT, RIOT Operating system, and the
  6LoWPAN network stack.

  Chapter 3 is about the underlying network stack that powers RIOT - GNRC.

  Chapter 4 is a thorough explaination of the wireguard protocol.

  Chapter 5 gives an evaluation of wireguard security, and how it help
  the IoT world.

  Chapter 6 gives some related works of other compressed VPN protocols, 
  and other evaluation of wireguard for constrained devices.

  Chapter 7 discusses the design and implementation of wireguard.

  Chapter 8 explains the testing of the wireguard.

  Chapter 9: conclusion and future works of this thesis.
