\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
  With more embedded device, the desire for security increased as well. This thesis
  provides an adaptation of a well-designed security protocols that show promising
  adaptation for the IoT worlds. The gnrc Wireguard implementation is functional
  whilst missing features on configuration to acutally be used in the production.

  Improvements can be maded to reduced the memory footprint, and power consumption
  of Wireguard. Further measurement and testing are required to ensure the correctness.
  Performance evaluation vs other security protoocls like DTLS and Diet-ESP, to
  present an overiew of how security protocols compete against each other.
