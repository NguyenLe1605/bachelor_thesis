\chapter{Conclusion}
  The main contribution of the thesis is an adaptation of the modern VPN protocol - Wireguard
  for GNRC, a network stack designed for embedded devices. The thesis first started
  with building up the background for the 6LoWPAN network protocol. Backing up by the
  knowledge of the network environment of the Internet of Things, the thesis continued by introducing
  the RIOT operating system and the design of the generic network stack GNRC. Then, it explained
  in detail the Wireguard protocols, especially in the mechanism of Noise handshake to 
  achieve desirable perfect forward secrecy and post-quantum security. With the previous foundation, 
  the thesis delved into the security features of Wireguard and the benefits it could bring to 
  the IoT field. Finally the thesis provided the design and implementation details of
  Wireguard for RIOT network stack. While the current implementation is functional, further
  performance benchmarking against other security protocols, and thorough testing are 
  required to identify the flaws and improve the quality of the project.
